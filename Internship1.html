      <div
        style="height: 100%; background-color: white; margin-top: 20px"
        class="requirement"
      >
        <h2>1. Requirement</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Duration and Timing</h3>
        <p>
          The internship takes place in the summer semester of Year 2 of the
          program (late May - late July). The internship must consist of at
          least 7 weeks of full-time work. It may be longer if you wish.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Type of Work</h3>
        <p>
          An internship provides a excellent opportunity for you to apply your
          software engineering skills in the real world. The internship should
          be practical software engineering work, either as an individual
          project or as part of a larger project. You are expected to be
          involved in the coding of a software application or a dynamic website.
          Work consisting entirely of routine testing, internal support,
          development of a static website, or data entry would not be suitable.
          As a guideline, you are expected to carry out at least the following
          amount of coding:
        </p>
        <br />
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Type of Programming Languages</th>
            <th>Amout of coding (not including comment)</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              Type of Programming Languages Amout of coding (not including
              comment) High-level languages, such as Python, Visual Basic,
              ActionScript
            </td>
            <td>480 lines</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>HTML + Mark-up/Scripting languages, such as PHP, JavaScript</td>
            <td>840 lines (not including the content of the web pages)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              Lower-level languages, such as C, C++, C#, Objective-C, Java
            </td>
            <td>840 lines</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <br />
        <p>
          At the beginning of the internship, you and your employer should agree
          on a clearly defined set of objectives of your work. It is acceptable
          for the internship to change direction as time goes on, provided that
          new objectives are identified and agreed. <br />
          The following examples illustrate opposite ends of the spectrum of
          suitable work:
        </p>
        <li>
          At the one end of the spectrum, a student working for a large company
          undertakes small clearly-defined pieces of work within a large
          project. The student must first make a significant effort to
          understand the existing framework, before going on to implementation
          of software components that will fit into that framework.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the other end of the spectrum, a student working for a small
          company develops a complete software package. The student first
          identifies the requirements, including a user interface design, and
          continues development through to a prototype implementation.
        </li>

        <h3>1.3 Supervision</h3>
        <p>
          Normally, the host company of your internship will assign a member of
          the company to be your supervisor. The supervisor will oversee the
          progress of your work and give you advice. The International College
          will also nominate one or more lecturers to be your internship
          advisors who will be available for consultation to both you and the
          company.
        </p>

      <!--Assessment-->
      <div style="height: 100%; background-color: white" class="requirement">
        <h3>2. Assessment</h3>
        <p>
          The internship is an assessed component of your study. During the
          internship, the company will monitor your performance and then submit
          their assessment to the International College. The company's
          assessment will cover various aspects of your internship, including:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>the quality and quantity of your work</li>
          <li>your attendance record</li>
          <li>
            other attributes a good software engineer should possess, such as
            punctuality, responsibility, human relations, creativity, etc.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          After your internship, you are required to submit an internship report
          and give a presentation of your work and your internship experience to
          the internship assessment committee. The committee will then evaluate
          your internship and give you either grade S (Satisfactory) or U
          (Unsatisfactory).
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Internship report</h3>
        <p>
          An internship report is a short report (1,500 words or more)
          detailing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a brief outline of the company (its size, its main activities, the
            division or project in which you were employed, etc.);
          </li>
          <li>
            the original placement description and objectives (and any later
            changes to these);
          </li>
          <li>what you actually did;</li>
          <li>
            an honest evaluation of how successfully you achieved your
            objectives;
          </li>
          <li>
            a summary of what you learned from working in an industrial
            environment (for example, tools, techniques, processes, group
            working, deadlines);
          </li>
          <li>
            a reflection on the value of the placement, and how it could have
            been better.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <i
          >The report should not just be a detailed technical description of
          what you did. The assessment committee is looking for a coherent,
          literate report in order to understand how your project fitted into
          the company you were working for, what you achieved, and your
          reflections on how the internship fitted into your educational
          experience.</i
        >
        <p>
          Here are some hints on preparing a good report. Make sure that your
          report has a clear logical structure – it should not be just an
          unstructured flow of words telling a story. Avoid simply quoting PR
          material about the organisation you worked for – think about what the
          reader needs to know about the organisation in order to understand the
          context of your work. Do not focus on minute technical detail
          describing intricate pieces of code that you wrote.<br />
          The biggest problem for most students seems to be reflecting on the
          internship experience.<br />
          Here are some questions you might like to think about in developing
          this part of the report:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What new skills did you learn?</li>
          <li>
            What existing skills did you exercise or improve during the
            internship?
          </li>
          <li>
            Did your internship experience reinforce your existing knowledge?
            (Did you observe techniques taught at the International College
            actually used in practice?)
          </li>
          <li>
            Were there any techniques that you would like to have known before
            undertaking the internship?
          </li>
          <li>How could the internship experience have been improved?</li>
          <li>
            What knowledge and experience will you take forward as the most
            important lessons from your internship?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <i
          >Both the content of the report and the quality of writing will be
          taken into account.</i
        >

        <h3>2.2 Presentation</h3>
        <p>
          After your internship, you are required to present your work and your
          experience during the internship to the assessment committee and your
          colleagues. You should plan for a 20-minute presentation, which will
          be followed by a 10-minute QA session.
        </p>
        <h3>2.3 Absence during internship</h3>
        <p>
          If, for any reason, you need to take a leave during the internship,
          you must ask for permission from the company. You must also submit a
          document supporting the request for your leave to your supervisor in
          the company (or a person who makes a record of your attendance).
          Absence without notice will result in failing the internship.
